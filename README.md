## Hi, I'm Jake

I'm a computer science student at Cal Poly SLO who likes to build digital things. 

Right now, I mostly develop React web apps with Next.js and TypeScript. Almost everything I make is on my GitHub, and my most notable projects are featured on [my personal website](https://jakeo.dev).
